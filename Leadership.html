					  <p>I am currently a junior aiming for a Master’s in Aerospace Engineering and a minor in both Engineering Management and Computer Science. I’m not only deeply passionate about each of these topics individually, but how they interact to create a discipline that fosters ingenuity and collaboration in the workplace as well.</p>
					  <p>As a recent US citizen and a native of South Africa I have found a great appreciation of the outdoors and the beauty that it unconditionally provides. I also look forward to enjoying the limitless opportunities that Colorado brings from a career development standpoint. With that in mind, I’m excited to coordinate exciting events to Tau Beta Pi!</p>

					  <h4>James Perkins<br><small>Vice President</small></h4>
					  <p>I’m a junior studying Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Computer Science, planning on a MS in Bioastronautics. After I graduate, I want to work on either finding extraterrestrial life or making us into extraterrestrial life through space settlement. I’ve worked at the Colorado Space Grant Consortium for a couple years and plan to continue doing so throughout undergrad. I’m from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, so I feel pretty at home here in another college town, and it’s been a true pleasure getting to know the area and all it has to offer.</p>
					  <p>When I’m not in class, I love to do theater, play music, and spend time in the great outdoors. I used to be more involved with film and orchestra, but there’s only so much time in the day! Nowadays, I spend more time taking walks, playing games with my friends, and spending time with my cat.</p>

					  <p>My name is Robert and I am a junior in Chemical Engineering. On top of that, I am also pursuing a minor in Computer Science as well as an independent research project with the Holewinski Group at CU. When not strapped for time, I like to exercise, practice guitar, and read.</p>
					  <p>I am passionate about community service and volunteering in Tau Beta Pi. I hope to make the organization an opportunity for its members to not only elevate themselves but to elevate those around them.

					  <p>I’m a current senior finishing up my bachelors in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a minor in computer science. I’m particularly interested in Embedded Software, Machine Learning, and FPGA design. I recently interned with Keystone Tower Systems, a startup out of Denver, and hope to start my career with them after graduation.</p>
					  <p>Outside of class I almost always find myself outdoors: in the summer I’ll be hiking or biking, and in the winter I’ll be skiing or snowshoeing. I play Ultimate Frisbee year-round; I play during the school year with CU’s team and over the summer with local club teams. I’ve been very involved in music through marching band and wind ensembles. I stopped once getting to college, but I play the clarinet or piano when I have a little bit of free time.

				  <p>I am a junior studying Chemical and Biological Engineering with a minor in Biomedical Engineering. While my various academic interests have led me to research biodegradable electronics and intern at Phillips 66 so far, I aim to explore different fields as much as I can while at CU. I also enjoy giving back to the school by working as a Course Assistant and volunteering for various student organizations. Outside of school, I enjoy spending my time either skiing or hiking with friends and family.</p>

Currently, I am a Senior Spacecraft Engineer at Atomos Space in Denver, designing space tugboats.</p>
						
						<p>As an undergraduate, I served first as corresponding secretary, then as president of the Colorado Beta chapter. Upon graduation with my BS/MS in aerospace engineering in May 2001, I was elected to the advisory board, and became chief advisor in 2003.  Since then, I have helped Colorado Beta host Tau Beta Pi National Conventions in 2006 and 2018. In 2016, I received the national Outstanding Advisor Award from Tau Beta Pi.  I am also a director of the Front Range Alumni Chapter, acting as liaison between the alumni and student chapters.</p>
						
						<p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading and watching programs about science, science-fiction, and fantasy. I can often be found riding my bike around Boulder or hiking along the trails. Other hobbies include knitting, sewing, and personal finance. Feel free to contact me with questions about Tau Beta Pi, anything space-related, life after college, etc.</p>
