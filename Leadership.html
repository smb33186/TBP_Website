						<p>I am an aerospace engineer who has done design, analysis, and operations of civil &amp; commercial, manned &amp; unmanned spacecraft for various companies before starting my own independent subcontracting business. My experience includes space situational awareness, orbital mechanics, systems engineering, electrical power systems, and environmental control &amp; life support systems.  Currently, I am a Senior Spacecraft Engineer at Atomos Space in Denver, designing space tugboats.</p>
						
						<p>As an undergraduate, I served first as corresponding secretary, then as president of the Colorado Beta chapter. Upon graduation with my BS/MS in aerospace engineering in May 2001, I was elected to the advisory board, and became chief advisor in 2003.  Since then, I have helped Colorado Beta host Tau Beta Pi National Conventions in 2006 and 2018. In 2016, I received the national Outstanding Advisor Award from Tau Beta Pi.  I am also a director of the Front Range Alumni Chapter, acting as liaison between the alumni and student chapters.</p>
						
						<p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading and watching programs about science, science-fiction, and fantasy. I can often be found riding my bike around Boulder or hiking along the trails. Other hobbies include knitting, sewing, and personal finance. Feel free to contact me with questions about Tau Beta Pi, anything space-related, life after college, etc.</p>
