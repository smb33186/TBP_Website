					  <h4>Robert Benke<br><small>President</small></h4>
					  <p>My name is Robert Benke, and I am a senior in Chemical Engineering. I have done internships with Denver Water and Erise IP, a patent law firm. Formerly, I served as the treasurer for the Colorado Beta Chapter. I really, really like everyone I have met and had the pleasure of working with in TBP, and there is fantastic potential for this organization, so I am incredibly excited to serve as president for the 2022-2023 school year. My goal is to make TBP more active on the CU Boulder campus by providing more opportunities for our members to engage with one another and develop meaningful relationships. When not wrestling with the monster known as an engineering degree, I enjoy songwriting, guitar practice, creative writing, reading, and exercise.</p>

					  <p>Hello everyone! Henri here - I'm the ex President and Outreach Coordinator of TBP CO Beta and the current Vice President! I am currently a Senior aiming for a Master’s in Aerospace Engineering and a minor in Computer Science. I’m not only deeply passionate about each of these topics individually, but how they interact to create a discipline that fosters innovation on the cutting edge of scientific discovery.</p>
					  <p>As a recent US citizen and a native of South Africa I have found a great appreciation of the outdoors and the beauty that it unconditionally provides. Outside of classes, I enjoy Hiking, Camping, Backpacking, Road Tripping, Reading, and Space! With that in mind, I’m excited to be your Vice President for the upcoming academic year!</p>

					  <p>My name is Will Steinfort and I am a third-year student at CU, pursuing a degree in Aerospace Engineering Science with a minor in Computer Science. I was born and raised in Colorado and love to take advantage of the great outdoors. Some of my favorite activities are golfing, hiking, going to the gym, and most of all, skiing. Outside of school, I am on the CU Freeski team, which allows me access my competitive side by competing in club sports.</p>
					  <p>Additionally, I am an undergraduate research assistant for Dr. Gupta in the CU LIFE lab. During the summer of 2022, Dr. Gupta was appointed as my advisor for the CU Summer Program for Undergraduate Research (SPUR), where I was tasked with exploring the capabilities of using Neural Networks to solve the multi-dimensional, non-linear partial differential equations that represent the charging dynamics of super-capacitors. I am now continuing my research part-time throughout the school year.</p>

					  <p>Hello! I'm a senior in aerospace engineering with a minor in computer science, and I'm currently pursuing a master's in bioastronautics through the BAM program. This year, I'm working on a research project in the bioastro lab as well as continuing an internship at Atomos space as a systems and test engineer. I'm super passionate about human spaceflight, space medicine, and our future as an interplanetary species.</p>
					  <p>I’m from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, so I feel pretty at home here in another college town; it’s been a true pleasure getting to know the area and all it has to offer. When I’m not in class, I love to play music, do DIY projects, and spend time in the great outdoors. I used to be more involved with theater and orchestra, but there’s only so much time in the day! Nowadays, I spend more time taking walks, playing video and tabletop games with my friends, and hanging out with my cat.</p>
