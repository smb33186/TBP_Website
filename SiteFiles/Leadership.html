					  <h4>Juliana Carmack<br><small>President</small></h4>
					  <p>I am a junior studying Civil Engineering with a prospective focus in structural and sustainable design. I plan to integrate renewables and natural energy flows into infrastructure, such as water flow through elevation and specified building placement/materials, to promote reduced energy consumption and the complete removal of carbon-based fuels. I hope to one day design buildings of this nature, which will lead me to a masters degree in sustainable design and/or architectural engineering.</p>
					  <p>When I’m not in school, I chase the beauties of life through travel, both in beautiful colorado and beyond. I hope that one day I will bring a sustainable motive to the multitude of places I visit and work in,</p>

					  <h4>Brock Cross<br><small>Vice President</small></h4>
					  <p>I will be finishing up my degree in mechanical engineering this May here at CU Boulder and I am very excited to serve the wonderful organization that is Tau Beta Pi my last year of college. I was born in New York, but my father served in the United States Army for the majority of my childhood so we moved around quite a bit. I have had the pleasure of seeing most of the country and meeting amazing people from all the places I have lived.</p>
					  <p>When I am not in the library, I enjoy skiing, hiking, fishing, and going to the gym. Also, I am currently working towards earning my private pilot’s license, as I have always had a passion for aviation. I have had two internships with Lockheed Martin – one as a mechanical engineer intern and the other as a systems engineer intern and I have enjoyed using the skills and knowledge learned in school to solve real world problems and help save lives.</p>

					  <h4>James Schultz<br><small>Treasurer</small></h4>
					  <p>I am a senior pursuing a BS degree in Mechanical Engineering with a minor in Computer Science and a certificate in leadership. My plan is to complete the bachelor’s Accelerated Master’s Program completing a master’s degree in Spring of 2022. During my time here at CU I have done my best to do everything I could during this once in a lifetime opportunity. I joined the Engineering Leadership Program (ELP) my freshman year which has since given me the opportunity to be a mentor for incoming students, an advisor on the student advisory council for ELP, and participate in a cultural immersion on a trip to Uganda and Rwanda. I have worked in the BOLD center as a tutor as well as the Idea Forge as a leading woodworking and sewing workshops.</p>
					  <p>Outside of school I like being outdoors and staying as active as I can. My favorite sport is probably basketball. You will likely see me at the Rec Center playing when I have some free time. I try to get to the mountains as much as I can whether it be for a hike, a camping trip or skiing. I enjoy going on bike rides, runs and anything that will get me outdoors really.</p>

					  <p>I am a senior studying Chemical Engineering with a minor in Business. I am part of the Living Materials Lab on campus studying Ice Recrystallization Inhibition of Biomimetic Antifreeze Polymers. My research interests include green energy and storage as well as biodegradable polymers. Over summers, I have completed three different internships at W.L. Gore &amp Associates, giving me experience in nanotechnology, adhesives, and fuel cell technology. I am actively involved in the Figure Skating Club on campus as well as the Global Engineering RAP. Outside of school, activities I enjoy include ice hockey, skiing, hiking and kayaking.</p>

					  <p>I am a senior in Civil Engineering here at the University of Colorado Boulder. After graduation, I hope to gain my Professional Engineer's license and work in transportation, specifically in airfield design. I have completed two summer internships with the Aviation Design Group at Jacobs Engineering.</p>
					  <p>I am a National Merit Scholar from Colorado. Before transferring to CU Boulder, I completed the first two years towards my degree at the University of Oklahoma. At OU, I was a member of the ASCE Concrete Canoe team where I competed as part of the paddling team and served a year as Financial Lead. In my spare time, I love running half marathons and charity races, hiking open spaces in my area, and volunteering at the Colorado House Rabbit Society.</p>

				  <p>I am a junior studying Chemical and Biological Engineering with a minor in Biomedical Engineering. While my various academic interests have led me to research biodegradable electronics and intern at Phillips 66 so far, I aim to explore different fields as much as I can while at CU. I also enjoy giving back to the school by working as a Course Assistant and volunteering for various student organizations. Outside of school, I enjoy spending my time either skiing or hiking with friends and family.</p>

					  <p>I am currently a sophomore aiming for a major in Aerospace Engineering and a minor in both Engineering Management and Computer Science. I’m not only deeply passionate about each of these topics individually, but how they interact to create a discipline that fosters ingenuity and collaboration in the workplace as well.</p>
					  <p>As a recent US citizen and a South Africa native, I have found a great appreciation of the outdoors and the beauty that it unconditionally provides. I also look forward to enjoying the limitless opportunities that Colorado brings from a career development standpoint. With that in mind, I’m excited to bring exciting events to TBP!</p>
