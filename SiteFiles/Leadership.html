						<h4>Stacy Hayes<br><small>President</small></h4>
						<p>I am a senior finishing up my BS in Computer Science with a minor in business. After graduation, I will be working for Lockheed Martin who I have interned with a couple of times. After a few years in the workforce, I am looking to come back for a graduate degree and, eventually, I would like to see the business side of problem solving by getting into management.</p>
						<p>I am a Colorado native and love the mountains and the activities that come with them. In the summer, I enjoy going boating and water-skiing with my family at lakes around the state. This year, in addition to my school work and role in Tau Beta Pi, I am also serving as a peer mentor and TA to a group of the engineering freshmen. I am excited to be a part of this amazing organization and expand our chapter's reach this year!</p>

					  <p>I am currently a Senior studying Computer Science with a minor in TAM, here at the University of Colorado Boulder. I have always had a passion for Math and Computer so I figured CS was the best way to combine both. I also enjoy being involved in community and volunteering. I am a board member of WiC and an active member of SHPE, both student organizations at the BOLD center. I often volunteer in immigration cases to help people fill out applications or translate. I really love giving back to community and TBP is the perfect place to help me do that. This is my second year in this amazing honor society, I am happy and excited to be part of it because of all the helping I get to do.</p>
					  <p>I was born here in the US, but I was raised in Mexico City since I was 1 year old until I was 20. I often go back to Mexico since all my family is there, in fact, I love traveling and try to go out of the country twice a year. In my free time I love going to the movies, hiking, dancing, going to concerts, and hanging out with my friends and siblings.</p>

					  <p>I am a senior studying chemical and biological engineering. I have a rather eclectic collection of academic interests, which is reflected by my minors: biomedical engineering, applied math, and philosophy.</p>
					  <p>Over several research projects in various fields, I’ve discovered that I’m most passionate about nanobiotechnology via synthetic biology: intelligently engineering microorganisms to create nanoscale systems underlying innovative, sustainable bioprocesses. I’m excited to continue researching in this field to create biotechnology with the potential to revolutionize the energy industry.</p>
					  <p>Outside of the classroom and lab, I volunteer as a peer mentor for freshmen, and I enjoy reading, cooking, playing instruments, and getting a breath of fresh air in the mountains—or rather, if I’m doing it right, many labored breaths!</p>

					  <p>I am a junior studying Civil Engineering with a prospective focus in structural and sustainable design. I plan to integrate renewables and natural energy flows into infrastructure, such as water flow through elevation and specified building placement/materials, to promote reduced energy consumption and the complete removal of carbon-based fuels. I hope to one day design buildings of this nature, which will lead me to a masters degree in sustainable design and/or architectural engineering.</p>
					  <p>When I’m not in school, I chase the beauties of life through travel, both in beautiful colorado and beyond. I hope that one day I will bring a sustainable motive to the multitude of places I visit and work in,</p>

						<p>I am an aerospace engineer who has done design, analysis, and operations of civil &amp; commercial, manned &amp; unmanned spacecraft for various companies before starting my own independent subcontracting business. My experience includes space situational awareness, orbital mechanics, systems engineering, electrical power systems, and environmental control &amp; life support systems.  Currently, I am a Senior Spacecraft Engineer at Atomos Space in Denver, designing space tugboats.</p>
						
						<p>As an undergraduate, I served first as corresponding secretary, then as president of the Colorado Beta chapter. Upon graduation with my BS/MS in aerospace engineering in May 2001, I was elected to the advisory board, and became chief advisor in 2003.  Since then, I have helped Colorado Beta host Tau Beta Pi National Conventions in 2006 and 2018. In 2016, I received the national Outstanding Advisor Award from Tau Beta Pi.  I am also a director of the Front Range Alumni Chapter, acting as liaison between the alumni and student chapters.</p>
						
						<p>In my spare time, I enjoy reading and watching programs about science, science-fiction, and fantasy. I can often be found riding my bike around Boulder or hiking along the trails. Other hobbies include knitting, sewing, and personal finance. Feel free to contact me with questions about Tau Beta Pi, anything space-related, life after college, etc.</p>

					  <h4>Greg Newcomb<br><small>District Director &amp; Chapter Advisor</small></h4>
					  <p>I've worked at CU's Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics (LASP) for nearly a decade as an Embedded Systems Engineer, which means I gets to combine three of my favorite hobbies: software, electronics, and space. My MS is in Electrical Engineering from CU Boulder.<p>
					  <p>I've acted as an advisor to the CU Boulder chapter since 2007 and before that served as the chapter President. I was appointed a TBP District Director in 2011, a post intended to facilitate communication between collegiate chapters and TBP HQ. My favorite parts of being involved with TBP are the frequent chapter visits, establishing relationships with chapter officers, and seeing officers grow into strong leaders.</p>
