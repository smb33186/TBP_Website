						<h4>Vismaya Bachu<br><small>President</small></h4>
						<p>I am currently a junior studying Chemical and Biological engineering here at CU Boulder. As a pre-medical student, I also intend to minor in Biomedical Engineering. My passion lies in science and I’m excited to someday work at the intersection of medicine and engineering technology.</p>
						<p>Although born in India, I was mostly raised here in Colorado. I love hiking 14ers and the outdoors. Growing up, dance, singing, and playing the violin were a fairly large part of my life. Additionally, I can’t seem set books down after I’ve started reading them; my favorite author is Dan Brown.</p>
						<p>Around campus, I’m also involved with volunteering in a sports medicine clinic, researching in a metabolic engineering lab, and bringing thought-provoking speakers to campus via the Distinguished Speakers Board.</p>

					  <p>I am currently a junior studying mechanical engineering with a minor in engineering management here at the University of Colorado Boulder. Out of the breadth of the mechanical engineering scope, I enjoy solid mechanics, CAD, and working in MATLAB the most.Outside of my coursework and activities in Tau Beta Pi, I am currently working in the College of Engineering's Non-linear Mechanics Lab, researching the adhesion and friction of patterned surfaces on soft, slippery substrates. I am also a brother in CU Boulder's Phi Sigma Pi National Honor Fraternity where I get to interact with people outside of the engineering college and do non-science things for a bit.</p>
					  <p>With what little free time that I have left I enjoy watching movies, sports, and TV, reading books, going to concerts, and spending time with my girlfriend.</p>

					  <h4>Stacy Hayes<br><small>Recording Secretary</small></h4>
					  <p>I am currently a junior pursuing my BS in Computer Science and a minor in business. After graduation, I would like to go into national defense working for a federal contractor or directly for the government. After a few years in the workforce, I am looking to come back for an MBA and explore the managerial side of things, however in the long run I want to stay close to the programming I love. This summer, I am looking forward to returning to Colorado Springs to continue my internship with Lockheed Martin.</p>
					  <p>I am a Colorado native and love the mountains and the activities that come with them. In the summer, I enjoy going boating and water-skiing with my family at lakes around the state. During school, I enjoy tutoring computer science subjects and this semester I am also teaching local elementary school kids about engineering through fun hands on activities through TeachEngineering.

					  <p>Hi everyone! I am the Corresponding Secretary for the 2018-2019 school year. I am currently a senior in the Mechanical Engineering program. Out of all the subfields within mechanical engineering, I enjoy systems, controls, and working with MATLAB the most. I am currently a TA for System Dynamics helping students with labs and homework problems while also taking Feedback Control as a technical elective. Other than TBP, I am also holding an officer position in the American Society of Engineering Management where I have the opportunity to practice my professional skills. Outside of school, I love hiking and throwing the football around.  Additionally, I have been playing the piano for about eleven years now, so every now and then I would sit down at a piano and practice some classical music!</p>

					  <p>I am currently a Junior studying Computer Science with a minor in TAM, here at the University of Colorado Boulder. I have always had a passion for Math and Computer so I figured CS was the best way to combine both. I also enjoy being involved in community and volunteering. I am a board member of WiC and an active member of SHPE, both student organizations at the BOLD center. I often volunteer in immigration cases to help people fill out applications or translate. I really love giving back to community and TBP is the perfect place to help me do that. Although is my first year as an officer, I am happy and excited to be part of it because of all the helping I get to do.</p>
					  <p>I was born here in the US, but I was raised in Mexico City since I was 1 year old until I was 20. I often go back to Mexico since all my family is there, in fact, I love traveling and try to go out of the country twice a year. In my free time I love going to the movies, hiking, dancing, going to concerts, and hanging out with my friends and siblings.</p>
