						<h4>Vismaya Bachu<br><small>President</small></h4>
						<p>I am currently a junior studying Chemical and Biological engineering here at CU Boulder. As a pre-medical student, I also intend to minor in Biomedical Engineering. My passion lies in science and I’m excited to someday work at the intersection of medicine and engineering technology.</p>
						<p>Although born in India, I was mostly raised here in Colorado. I love hiking 14ers and the outdoors. Growing up, dance, singing, and playing the violin were a fairly large part of my life. Additionally, I can’t seem set books down after I’ve started reading them; my favorite author is Dan Brown.</p>
						<p>Around campus, I’m also involved with volunteering in a sports medicine clinic, researching in a metabolic engineering lab, and bringing thought-provoking speakers to campus via the Distinguished Speakers Board.</p>

					  <h4>Sean Sundberg<br><small>Treasurer</small></h4>
					  <p>I am currently a junior studying mechanical engineering with a minor in engineering management here at the University of Colorado Boulder. Out of the breadth of the mechanical engineering scope, I enjoy solid mechanics, CAD, and working in MATLAB the most.Outside of my coursework and activities in Tau Beta Pi, I am currently working in the College of Engineering's Non-linear Mechanics Lab, researching the adhesion and friction of patterned surfaces on soft, slippery substrates. I am also a brother in CU Boulder's Phi Sigma Pi National Honor Fraternity where I get to interact with people outside of the engineering college and do non-science things for a bit.</p>
					  <p>With what little free time that I have left I enjoy watching movies, sports, and TV, reading books, going to concerts, and spending time with my girlfriend.</p>

					  <h4>Joel Courtney<br><small>Recording Secretary</small></h4>
					  <p>I am sophomore studying Aerospace Engineering and Computer Science, and I hope to graduate in 2020 or 2021. I like all things STEM, but I particularly gravitate toward orbital mechanics and computers. I love writing electronic music and coding random, useless programs for fun, and I am a founding member of the CU Boulder Racing Team.</p>
					  <p>I was born in California, but raised in Texas; and I moved to Colorado in 2010. I love all manner of hiking, biking, climbing, and snowboarding, even though I'm not terribly good at any of them. I work in OIT as an admin for CU's Linux-based systems; and when all other activities fail, I enjoy wasting my life on mindless video games.</p>

					  <h4>Nickalaus Clemmer<br><small>Colorado Mesa University Representative</small></h4>
					  <p>I currently attend Colorado University at Boulder working towards my mechanical engineering degree and Colorado Mesa University for my physics degree. Engineering was an obvious choice for me because it combined my love of mathematics, science, and problem-solving into a blend of work that is both rewarding and can aid in developing the technology of the future. I am passionate about my education because I know that it is the foundation for all of my future goals and aspirations. I plan to continue to graduate school in pursuit of masters and doctorate degrees in engineering.</p>
					  <p>Outside of class, I engage in numerous outdoor activities and participate in several clubs on CMU campus. I have lived in Western Colorado for the past 17 years and find the landscape in and around Grand Junction to be the perfect blend of desert and mountainous terrain. I enjoy hiking, fishing, biking, and camping in the surrounding areas. I am honored to be a national council member of the Society of Physics Students and the president and founder of the Mesa Jugglers Club.</p>

					  <h4>Norma Langdon<br><small>Corporate Liaison</small></h4>
					  <p>I am senior studying Chemical and Biological Engineering and will graduate in May 2018. Upon graduation, I hope to work in the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industry as a Process Engineer. I have worked as an undergraduate researcher for the Shirts Group over the past year and a half, executing computational research into nanoporous membranes. Over the summer, I interned at Merck and am excited to bring my experience to Tau Beta Pi and, hopefully, help members land similar opportunities.</p>
					  <p>I was born in Vancouver, British Columbia, but now call Colorado Springs home. I love to ski – I even lived in Whistler for a couple of years. I also play lacrosse, but really spend most of my free time watching Netflix (engineering school is tiring, right). My goals for the immediate future include landing a job and getting a dog.</p>
