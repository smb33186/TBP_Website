						<h4>Nathan Stambaugh<br><small>President</small></h4>
						<p>Hi everyone! I am proud to be the current president of the Colorado beta chapter and hope to improve our chapters visibility and reputation at CU. I am a 4th year student in the BS/MS program studying architectural engineering. I will be happily graduating in May of 2017 with both my degrees. Phew! What most interests me is dynamic structural systems and sustainable structural materials development. Competition is important to me. I enjoy of all kinds and always feel at home on a team. Biking, everywhere, is the key to my happiness and often the cause of my tardiness. My hobbies are reading (stoic and history books), watching comedic videos (usually people doing stupid things), procrastinating my running schedule and watching "Futball". I also enjoy long walks, alone, sorry no dating profile here. For the most part, I am game for anything interesting, new and fun. If you have any questions, wanna design some super light concrete, a miniature damping system or just tell me about something new I am more than happy to hear from you.</p>

						<h4>Ji Hoon (Andy) Kim<br><small>Vice President</small></h4>
						<p>Hello, my name is Andy Kim and I am the Vice President of Tau Beta Pi at Colorado Beta. Currently, I am an undergrad in ECE/Applied Mathematics and expecting to graduate in 2017. I chose electrical engineering out of sheer love for mathematics, creating things, and hopes for impacting my profession. I carry these passions to our own organization, Tau Beta Pi, as well in order to help create a change.</p>
						<p>A little about me, I grew up mostly in Boulder having moved here at a young age. Coming from a family of electrical engineers, I could not avoid the influence of mathematics and science early on. Unsurprisingly, combined with the influence of mathematics early on, deciding to go into engineering was not a difficult nor indecisive decision.</p>
						<p>I also have many pastimes to accompany my love for engineering. My hobbies include rock climbing, playing tennis, practicing the piano and hanging out with friends. In addition, I enjoy messing around with circuits, programming and simulating things as well.</p>
						<p>I look forward to an amazing year with Tau Beta Pi!</p>

						<h4>Alex Viert<br><small>Corresponding Secretary</small></h4>
						<p>Alexandrea is a Junior from Fort Collins, Colorado and is studying Chemical and Biological Engineering. She expects to graduate in May of 2017 and is Corresponding Secretary of Tau Beta Pi for the 2015-2016 academic year. Alexandrea has traveled to Costa Rica, Ireland, the UK, and Venice, as well as many other major places in continental Europe. When not studying, which is getting rarer through Junior year, she loves to read, ski, and hike, as well as drink tea during Netflix marathons, and watch Avalanche games. She is also involved in various groups on campus including the Society of Women Engineers, and of course Tau Beta Pi. Currently, she is an Undergraduate Research Assistant in the Anseth Lab at CU-Boulder, and is an undergraduate TA for CHEN 1310: Introduction to Engineering Computing. Some of her skills include: tissue culture, Microsoft Excel/VBA, and Mathematica.</p>
